<h2>About me:</h2>
I’m a creative force in cybersecurity with an out-of-the-box approach to problem-solving. I’m committed to continuous learning and staying ahead in the forever changing cybersecurity landscape. A blue teamer with the mindset of a red teamer.
<br /> <br />
Currently, I am looking for SOC Analyst, Security Engineering, and Cloud Security roles. My goal is to eventually specialize in firewall configurations and management or become a third tier SOC Threat Hunter!
